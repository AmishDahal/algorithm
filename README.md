# Bucket Indexing Sort Algorithm (amish sorting)

This repository contains an implementation of the **Bucket Indexing Sort Algorithm** **Amishsort** in **C**. It is a novel approach to sorting based on indexing values directly into their respective "buckets."

## Overview

The bucket indexing sort algorithm is a space-efficient sorting technique that utilizes indexing for optimal sorting without frequent element swapping.
